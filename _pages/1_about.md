## Me At a Glance

Everyone starts somewhere...I started out in a small Colorado mountain town, bounced to Arkansas, then to Kansas City, then to Seattle, then to Los Angeles, and now I'm back in Seattle and relishing the *sweet sweet* rain.

During a good portion of my time adventuring around the US, I have been pursuing a career as a producer in the gaming industry. To date, I have worked in both mobile and AAA -- with some of the biggest publishers, and on some of the largest franchises, out there. 

Right now, I'm a Senior Producer at Turtle Rock Studios (famous for *Left 4 Dead*, *Evolve*, and *Back 4 Blood*) making a return to the AAA way of life. 

Up here in the PNW, I live a now pretty quiet life of nature, work, and the pursuit of hobbies with the support of my wonderful partner and two adorable fluffy cats named Mason and Morri.

Cue the Paul Rudd clip we all know and love from Hot Ones!

## A Deeper Look Into My Path

Enamored with the entertainment industries from a young age, I had always dreamt of turning my small-town life into a bustling West Coast existence.

I began playing video games when I was about 4 years old, and just really never stopped. My PC was my after-school haven (now my after-work haven), and arcades are where I made my best memories. Throughout my childhood, I sought music and writing as possible career paths, until my my Gifted Studies teacher nudged me in the STEM direction in high school. Invigorated and following in my father’s footsteps, I started learning basic computer science – starting out in Java and Oracle-designed IDEs.

I had grown up with computers, but it was only here where I began to understand how they did the things they could do. 
My interest grew, and as I approached college, I decided to see what opportunities I could find in the gaming industry – to see if I could make a career of a hobby that had always been there for me.

My father mentioned [DigiPen](https://www.digipen.edu/) as a possibility, and after a bout of research, I applied. Once accepted, I decided to pack my bags and move halfway across the country from Kansas to the beautiful Pacific Northwest. With the support of my parents, brother, professors, friends, two cats (Nyxi and Tornado), and a beefy pupperino (Stella), I graduated from DigiPen in May 2017 as one of two women in the BSCS RTIS (Real-Time Interactive Simulation) program. 

Shortly after, I moved to LA and began working on *Call of Duty Black Ops* - for about 5 years. Then I jumped over to EA and worked on *Battlefield Mobile*. After a short time there, brought to an end by an unexpected layoff, I landed at [Turtle Rock Studios](https://turtlerockstudios.com/) - where I still am today.
